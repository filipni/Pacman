* Implement remaining ghosts
* Optimize decision-making for ghosts
* Draw each ghost's destination for debugging
* Distance between positions should be calculated from each block's center point
* Encapsulate data in the ghosts' Update() method. Mainly improve the code by just giving them access to each entities position (instead of the whole object).
* Create a vector-object?
* Some recurring code in the Update() method shold be moved to the parent ghost class
